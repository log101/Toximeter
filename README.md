Personalized Toxic Exposure Meter for Shellhacks 2021

## Inspiration

Although a good night's sleep and a bunch of pills can get you back on your feet, most of the diseases are much more critical, hard to diagnose, and definitely not that simple. But we tend to ignore everyday actions that gradually build up toxicity in our bodies and after years of accumulation result in severe chronic diseases and cancer. It means millions of lives lost and trillions of dollars spent on health care. Research shows that these diseases can be prevented by taking simple precautionary actions against toxic agents which include UV radiation, gas emissions, alcohol, and many more. We decided under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Sarper Diler (Istanbul University) to tackle this problem by providing people personalized toxic estimates according to their daily activities and guides on how to minimize the toxic load.

## What it does

ToxiMeter is a mobile application providing a personalized toxic assessment that enables users to see their daily and weekly exposure to the toxic agents. Our application provides highlights for activities that impacted the users most so that they can take relevant precautionary actions. Also in parallel to that, ToxiMeter provides tips and articles guiding and helping users minimize their daily exposure.

## How we built it

We used Balsamiq Cloud for wireframing and Flutter for application development

## Challenges we ran into

As we are dealing with a healthcare issue we needed professional medical advice. Thanks to Prof. Sarper Diler in Istanbul University and our team member Ahmed, we were able to make our app scientifically acceptable.
Our team was not that experienced with Flutter. But we were able to pace quickly thanks Balsamiq wire-framing tool. Also deciding who is going to do what was a hard task. Sometimes we had to switch roles in order to work more efficiently. Also, one of our team member's work was cut by an electricity outage. We worked extra to accommodate this issue.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We converted an idea into a solid project.

## What we learned

First of all, we all learned how a team should work. Also, we got our hands dirty with Flutter, this experience will help us a lot in the future. Apart from that, we learned to work in a time-efficient manner and the importance of planning.

## What's next for ToxiMeter

Firstly, we will improve the toxic load assessment because not all factors impact the toxic load the same way. We will balance them according to the current scientific findings. Also we will work on the design and back-end implementation.
